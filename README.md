## Human Stress Prediction Using Activity Data

- A comparative analysis of state of the art machine learning methods with AutoML for forecasting diverse time series

## Description

The primary goal of the study is to contribute to stress prediction using activity data, enabling early intervention and adjustments in daily routines to mitigate stress effectively.
We conducted a comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms, including LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Decision Tree, and SVM for Human Activity Recognition and stress prediction. 

The objective is to address the following research question:
* RQ1. Can the accuracy of stress prediction be enhanced by incorporating activity duration, activity frequency, or both for users?
* RQ2. Can the accuracy of stress prediction be improved by utilizing data collected closer to the time when the ground truth was captured, as opposed to using data from the entire day?
